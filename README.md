# Audible Player
The intention of this project is to offer old people a possibility to listen to audio books (currently via Audible Online Player and downloaded Audible mp3 files). I made a box for my half blind 98 years old grandmother.

Basically this uses a raspberry pi 3 B+ with some buttons, an RFID Reader and Chromium in the background to serve books in an easy to use way (without any screen or touch and other modern nonsense (: ).

Idea based on the [BookPlayer](https://github.com/wkjagt/BookPlayer) from [wkjagt](https://github.com/wkjagt) (Thanks for the awesome idea!). For offline use I recommend the open source Audible manager [openaudible](https://github.com/openaudible/openaudible).

By the way: I'm not associated with any of the proprietary softwares or companies used or named.

## Documentation
At the moment there is just the code. Later I will provide a step by step guide to build such a box on a website which you can access from this readme. Also there will be more code documentation.
